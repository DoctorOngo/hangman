# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## milestone_2.py
This script takes a list of words and selects a random word output

It also allows the user to input a letter and checks if the letter is a single alphabetical character

## milestone_3.py
This script adds to the functionality of milestone_2.py.

It checks if an user input is valid and whether it is within a given word

## milestone_4.py
This script creates a functioning Hangman game, however doesn't include end game criteria.

# milestone_5.py
